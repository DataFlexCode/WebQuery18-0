# WebQuery20-0
WebQuery for DataFlex 20.0

Some quick patches so you can at least compile and run it under DataFlex 20.0.
This does not make it all work, nor does it make it 64 bit compatible (at all)!

This workspace depends on the Stables library, get it here: https://github.com/DataFlexCode/Stables20
