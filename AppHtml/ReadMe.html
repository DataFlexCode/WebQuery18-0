<b><u>Instructions for using the WebQuery library</u></b>

<p>Extract the workspace zip file to a directory (you have probably already done this).</p>

<p><span style="color: red; font-weight: 700; text-decoration: underline">
If you are using a language other than English</span>, you should open the DF 20.0 Database Builder
from the "Tools" menu in the Studio.
In Database Builder from the menu choose "File" -> "Select Workspace", navigate to the WebQuery workspace
and open "WebQuery200.sws". Then from the menu select "Maintenance" -> "Reindex", then in the dialog click
"Select All", then "Reindex". In the Reindex dialog click the lower of the two "All" buttons followed by
the "Reindex" button - the process should only take a few seconds, after which you can close the dialogs
("OK" then "Cancel") and exit Database Builder.</p>

<p>Open the DataFlex Studio</p>

<p>From the Studio menu select: "Project" -> "Project Properties &lt;WebApp.src&gt;",
then in the dialog and click the "Register WebApp" button
followed by "OK". When it has finished, click "OK" to close the dialog.</p>

<p>Compile and run (F5) the WebApp.src project - further instructions are available in
the application (or directly in
<a href="WebQueryUsage.html" target="blank">WebQueryUsage.html</a>), as well
as a variety of examples of how WebQuery can be employed.</p>
